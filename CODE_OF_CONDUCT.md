# Code of Conduct / Community Participation Guidelines

As a community we welcome everyone, and encourage a friendly and positive environment.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed
to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of
conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned
from the community.

### Expected Behaviour

We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. 
Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issue, 
pull request, comment, email, or chat text) devoid of vocal tone, gestures, 
or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is especially important 
that you convey these attitudes in text. This includes the following behaviors:

- **Assume positive intent**: When someone posts something we expect community 
members will assume positive intent on the part of the post. We may choose to 
disagree with the idea and reject the suggestion, but we expect that it was made
in order to be supportive of the community goals. 

- **Respectful to participants**: We expect participants will disagree on aspects 
of this project. Disagreements must remain professional. Even if we reject 
someone’s idea, we continue to welcome their participation. And if your idea 
is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter. 

- **Seek to understand**: Open Source projects can be learning experiences. 
When someone poses something you find disagreeable or you don’t understand it, 
inquire about it. Ask, explore, challenge, and then assert if you agree or disagree.

- **Welcoming to new members**: New members bring fresh perspectives. Many will 
raised questions that have been addressed before, You can point them to existing 
discussions for them to get up to speed. Don’t punish them for being new to the 
project -- everyone is new to every project once.

- **Kind to beginners** : Beginners use open source projects to get experience. 
They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality 
code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to to reject code with kindness.

- **Consider your impact on others**: Your work will be used by others, and you 
depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and 
establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.

- **Use words carefully**: We may not understand intent when you say something 
ironic. Poe’s Law suggests that without an emoticon is it likely that someone will 
misinterpret sarcasm. We ask community members to communicate plainly.

- **Exit with class**: There may come a time where you stop believing in the project 
direction or get frustrated with the project leaders. You are always free to fork 
the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly accommodates this. 
It does not have to be dramatic or bitter. Sometimes you just walk away, and it’s OK.

- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity
contributes to the strength of our community, which is composed of people from
a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on
issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each
other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and
learning from mistakes.
  
### Unexpected Behaviour 

Participants in this open source community remain in good standing when they 
do not conduct themselves in a manner that violates this Code of Conduct. 
Misconduct includes:

- Calling out project members by their identity or background in a deliberately 
negative or insulting manner. This includes but is not limited to slurs or 
insinuations related to protected or suspect classes such as race, color, 
citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion, sexual orientation, 
gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features, 
language, profession, membership of a national minority, mental or physical ability.
- Insulting remarks about a person’s lifestyle practices.
- Threats of violence or intimidation or any project member.
- Unwanted sexual attention or behavior unsuitable for the topic of the open source project.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.

We cannot list all forms of harassment in an exhaustive manner, nor do we seek to 
declare some forms of harassment as benign or not worthy of action. Rather, if a 
project member feels harassed we ask they report the incident. The incident will 
be recorded and addressed. Furthermore we insist that the victim of this harassment 
not address the issue in the forum in public, as this tends to intensify the problem 
for the parties in question and for the community as a whole.


### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination
based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
disabilities.
