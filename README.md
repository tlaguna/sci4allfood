# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Sci4AllFood project!!
Repository of the project "Citizensâ€™ food-related daily problem solving by engaging multidisciplinary scientific communities".

The main aim of this project is to create a Food Science Shop around the Madrid region, which could be extended to other Spanish areas.

We are happy to welcome everybody to collaborate in this project.

### Vision statement

We will work with other scientists to fix common food-related problems for people in the Madrid area. We will provide tools to connect people with scientists, where citizens will expose their issues with food and nutrition. Scientists will create specific open projects and will work in collaboration to help solve these problems. We are working open because we think transparency is the key to connect Science with the society.

Science Shops are organisations that make knowledge available to local communitites or civil society organisations that donâ€™t have the means to pay or perform research themselves.
Science Shops respond to civil societyâ€™s needs for expertise and knowledge by conducting community-based participatory research (CBPR).
