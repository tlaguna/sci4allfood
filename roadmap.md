#Sci4AllFood

## Vision statement
We will work with other scientists to fix common food problems for people in Madrid. We will provide tools to connect people with scientists, where citizens will expose their issues with food and nutrition. Scientists will create specific open projects and will work in collaboration to help solve these problems. We are working open because we think transparency is the key to connect Science with the society.

## Motivation
The recently coming of new technologies by which almost everybody is connected have not facilitated the widespread of scientific knowledge. Instead, the immediate and brief facet of the information we receive daily has made the propagation of pseudosciences more easy than ever. In addition, in the field of food and nutrition there are non-evidence-based statements spread everyday which in some cases may be harmful for people's health. 

In order to make Science closer to citizens, we aimed to create a platform where they can propose daily food/nutrition related problems to scientists and then those can elaborate a scientifical/technical solution to find the solutions.


## How to get involved

## Workplan
1. Generate the infrastructure to connect to the public
  * Evaluate creating a "Science Shop"
  * Evaluate a first round of problems from close researchers
  * Build a website

2. Create a scientific network as the problem evaluators
  * Ask in current personal scientific networks
  * Contact scientific communities

3. Receive the first input problems from the citizens
  * Via web 
  * Participate in scientific events 
  * Through the science shop

4. Start the first project
  * Discuss with the scientific evaluators how to proceed and who to contact
  * Generate spaces and look for means to facilitate the scientific solvers
  * DAssign roles in the solvers team
